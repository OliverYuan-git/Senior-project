# CSDS 395 Project: Wide-Reach Classification
**By Ricky Lin, Daniel Lin, Oliver Yuan**  
**Supervisor: Prof. Liberatore**

## Introduction
Wide-reach classification addresses the challenge of achieving high precision in unbalanced binary classification problems, such as record matching, entity matching, or junk mail filters. This approach uses Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) to determine decision schemes with integral variables, aiming to minimize overfitting caused by outliers and noise in the training set. Additionally, the problem can be approached using the Two-Group Misclassification method with Lagrangian relaxation and branch-and-cut algorithms.
